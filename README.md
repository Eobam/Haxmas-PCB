# Haxmas-PCB
A PCB I created in EasyEDA for Hack Club's Haxmas!

The PCB includes two stick figure images I mad,e which are Santa and an Elf. Santa is holding a button fidget, and the Elf is holding, well, nothing. 

The button does not connect to anything, it's just a fidget (which I am also including to practice my soldering).
